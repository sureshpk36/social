Personal Responsibility Competencies (PRC)
Self-Determination & Self-Regulation

1. Scenario:
Imagine you’re aiming to earn a professional certificate, but unexpected personal setbacks arise. How would you apply self-determination and self-regulation to remain focused?

Applying Self-Determination:

Stay Inspired – Reconnect with the purpose behind pursuing the course, like career growth or passion for learning.
Adapt When Necessary – Adjust study times to accommodate life changes.
Seek Encouragement – Rely on peers, mentors, or online communities for motivation and accountability.
Using Self-Regulation:

Break It Down – Turn the overall goal into small, manageable actions.
Optimize Study Sessions – Plan learning when concentration levels are highest.
Track and Reflect – Use journals or digital tools to monitor achievements.
Adjust Mindfully – Accept that plans may need tweaking, and adapt instead of giving up.
Handle Stress Proactively – Incorporate regular movement, mindfulness, or short walks to recharge.
2. Reasoning:
How does self-regulation help in decision-making under pressure? Can you share a personal moment where self-regulation led to a smart choice?

Influence on Decisions:

Keeps Emotions in Check – Supports calm and focused thinking.
Prevents Impulsive Moves – Reduces chances of poor, stress-driven decisions.
Promotes Solution-Oriented Thinking – Shifts focus toward solving, not stressing.
Creates Structure – Helps sort tasks even during chaos.
Personal Story:
There was a time I faced a tough choice—submit a project and prepare for an exam on the same day. Initially overwhelmed, I considered pulling an all-nighter. But using self-regulation, I made a better choice. I created a balanced plan, scheduled short breaks, stayed optimistic, and reminded myself to just focus and give it my best. The result was both tasks completed with peace of mind.

Well-being: PERMA Model

3. Scenario:
In a fast-paced work environment filled with tight deadlines, how would you sustain your mental well-being and support your colleagues using the PERMA framework?

Application of PERMA:

Positive Emotion – Cultivate optimism by celebrating small wins and maintaining a cheerful outlook.
Engagement – Dive deep into tasks using your strengths, and assist teammates when they’re struggling.
Relationships – Strengthen bonds by offering help, checking in on coworkers, and promoting unity.
Meaning – Reinforce the idea that our work serves a greater purpose, boosting morale.
Accomplishment – Set bite-sized goals and recognize both individual and team achievements.
By applying PERMA, I can manage stress better and contribute to a more connected and resilient work atmosphere.

4. Reasoning:
How does the absence of meaning in work affect one’s drive and results? Share a case where personal achievements improved someone’s well-being.

Impact of Meaninglessness:
Lacking purpose in one’s work can drain energy, lead to disinterest, and cause underperformance. Without a sense of importance, tasks feel tedious and unrewarding, which affects commitment and emotional well-being.

Example:
A teacher passionate about education spends years nurturing young minds. Witnessing students evolve, overcome obstacles, and achieve goals becomes a meaningful cycle. These accomplishments reinforce the teacher’s purpose, boosting morale, energy, and engagement. Fulfillment from meaningful work contributes not only to job satisfaction but also to personal growth and well-being.

Volunteerism

5. Scenario:
You’ve committed to volunteer at an animal shelter this weekend, but your friends suddenly invite you for a trip. What would influence your decision?

Factors Affecting the Choice:

Integrity and Accountability – Standing by a commitment shows reliability and builds trust.
Consideration for Others – Canceling last-minute would burden other volunteers and affect shelter operations.
Personal Values – Choosing to volunteer aligns with personal beliefs of service over spontaneity.
Seeking Balance – Explore compromise by adjusting timings to accommodate both responsibilities and leisure, if possible.
Being accountable means thinking beyond personal enjoyment and considering the impact of my actions on others.

6. Reasoning:
How does volunteering shape an individual’s personal development while benefiting society? Give a real-world example.

Dual Impact of Volunteering:
On a personal level, volunteering nurtures empathy, confidence, and leadership. For society, it bridges service gaps and uplifts communities.
Example:
The Red Cross stands as a global example of impactful volunteering. Volunteers help during disasters, offer medical aid, and support affected communities. While the community receives vital assistance, volunteers themselves gain experience, compassion, and a sense of purpose—illustrating a two-way benefit that fosters growth on both ends.

Social Responsibility Competencies (SRC)
7. Scenario:
Your employer is accused of polluting a local river. Reporting it might risk your job. How would you handle this ethically?

Ethical Approach:

Verify Facts – Collect evidence to confirm the claim.
Report Internally First – Use internal channels to raise the issue discreetly.
Promote Compliance – Educate decision-makers on legal and environmental risks.
Seek Legal Protection – Consult whistleblower rights to ensure safety.
Escalate If Needed – If ignored internally, consider safe reporting to authorities.
Maintaining integrity while balancing personal safety is key to responsible action.

8. Reasoning:
How do individual acts like reducing waste lead to wider environmental change? Share an example.

Ripple Effect of Individual Action:
Small, repeated efforts by individuals create a collective shift. These changes shape consumer demand, inspire policies, and push industries to become more sustainable.

Example:
The global movement against single-use plastics began with individuals switching to reusable items. Over time, this demand influenced retailers to offer alternatives and governments to enforce bans. Thus, personal responsibility leads to systemic change.

9. Scenario:
You’re leading a team with two members locked in conflict. How would you mediate calmly?

Peaceful Conflict Resolution:

Stay Neutral – Avoid taking sides.
Listen First – Understand both perspectives through one-on-one talks.
Facilitate Dialogue – Encourage a respectful discussion to find common ground.
Refocus on Team Goals – Highlight shared objectives.
Set Boundaries – Clearly define expected professional behavior.
Follow-Up – Check in regularly to ensure the issue is resolved.
Resolving conflict through fairness and empathy helps rebuild trust and boost team cohesion.

10. Reasoning:
What approaches help resolve disagreements respectfully, without conflict?

Strategies for Respectful Resolution:

Listen with Empathy – Make the other person feel heard.
Keep Emotions in Check – Respond calmly, even when tensions rise.
Use Constructive Language – Speak from your own experience instead of blaming.
Seek Win-Wins – Aim for outcomes that benefit everyone.
Respect Timeouts – Pause discussions if emotions escalate.
Be Understanding – Try seeing the situation through the other’s perspective.
These approaches foster mutual respect and long-term harmony.




UNIT – 3 (5 Marks)
Social Marketing and Entrepreneurship

Scenario 1:
A government health agency wants to reduce smoking among young adults. How would you build a campaign that effectively encourages behavioral change?

Answer:
I would craft a youth-oriented social marketing campaign that uses platforms they actively engage with—such as Instagram, YouTube, and mobile games. The campaign would feature relatable influencers and use humor, storytelling, and vibrant visuals to deliver the message. Instead of emphasizing long-term health risks, we’d highlight immediate downsides like bad breath, poor stamina, or reduced social acceptance.
We would also collaborate with schools and community spaces to host peer-led discussions. Continuous feedback via social media polls and interactive sessions would guide future adjustments, ensuring the campaign remains engaging and effective.

Reasoning:
How is social marketing different from commercial marketing? Why does it demand a unique strategy?

Answer:
Social marketing focuses on public good—like changing harmful habits or promoting environmental responsibility—whereas commercial marketing aims at selling products or services for profit. Social marketing requires building emotional trust, addressing cultural and psychological barriers, and often tackling taboo topics.
Because it deals with deeply personal or complex issues, social marketing campaigns must be more sensitive, empathetic, and long-term in approach—often involving collaborations, storytelling, and grassroots community engagement for success.

Scenario 2:
A local NGO wants to boost recycling habits in their community. Which social marketing methods would help drive participation?

Answer:
The NGO can use gamified recycling challenges where residents earn points and win rewards for eco-friendly behavior. Engaging stories, visuals, and local testimonials shared through community radio, WhatsApp groups, and events would build awareness.
Partnerships with local businesses to offer discounts in exchange for recyclables and hands-on demonstrations at markets or schools can also spark interest. Feedback forms and community meetings would help improve outreach based on people’s real needs and suggestions.

Reasoning:
Why is audience segmentation vital in social campaigns? Give a successful example.

Answer:
Segmenting the audience allows tailored messaging that resonates deeply with each group. A message that works for teenagers won’t necessarily influence parents or seniors.
Example: The “Truth” anti-smoking campaign segmented teens and focused on anti-authority themes. Instead of scaring them, it exposed how tobacco companies manipulate youth—appealing to their sense of independence. This approach reduced teen smoking significantly and shows how the right segmentation boosts impact.

Marketing Mix Scenario:
You are introducing a low-cost water purifier for rural populations. How would you use the 4Ps to ensure effective adoption?

Answer:

Product: Create a simple, durable purifier suited for local water conditions and understandable by people with low literacy levels.
Price: Offer subsidized or installment-based pricing to ensure affordability for all income levels.
Place: Distribute via trusted channels like local kiosks, health centers, and mobile vans.
Promotion: Run demos by respected village leaders or health workers, using easy-to-understand visuals and storytelling in local dialects to spread awareness.
Reasoning:
How does the social marketing mix differ from the traditional 4Ps?

Answer:
In social marketing, the “product” is often a behavior change (like using a water purifier), not a physical good. “Price” includes time, effort, and cultural barriers, not just money. “Place” focuses on accessibility—like holding workshops in remote areas.
Additional Ps include:

Policy – Laws and rules that support change (e.g., health regulations).
Partnerships – Working with NGOs or local influencers to boost reach.
This holistic framework ensures deeper and more sustainable impact than traditional marketing.
Scenario:
An NGO wants to promote financial literacy workshops in underserved neighborhoods. What strategy using the social marketing mix would you recommend?

Answer:

Product: Practical sessions with relatable examples, budgeting tips, and post-workshop support.
Price: Offer free classes and reduce psychological barriers by using familiar community leaders.
Place: Conduct sessions in schools, markets, and local temples or mosques.
Promotion: Use local radio, influencers, posters, and testimonials to generate trust.
Policy: Collaborate with banks to promote savings schemes.
Partnerships: Engage financial institutions and community centers for better reach.
Reasoning:
Why is pricing such a critical part of social campaigns? Share an example where pricing influenced success.

Answer:
In social campaigns, setting the right price isn’t just about affordability—it’s about perception. Too high a cost deters participation, while zero cost may reduce perceived value.

Example:
When insecticide-treated bed nets were priced even minimally in African communities, adoption dropped significantly. But once NGOs provided them free, usage increased, drastically reducing malaria cases. This proves pricing can make or break impact in social marketing.

Marketing Process Scenario:
You’re helping a social enterprise promote eco-friendly reusable bags. Describe the marketing process you’d recommend.

Answer:

Research – Identify eco-conscious consumers, study local habits, and assess price sensitivity.
UVP (Unique Value Proposition) – Promote the long-term savings, durability, and environmental impact.
Pricing Strategy – Use discounts and loyalty programs to boost adoption.
Awareness – Use social media, community events, and eco-challenges to build visibility.
Sales Channels – Distribute via shops, e-commerce, and NGO partners.
Promotions – Organize referral contests, limited-time deals, and green behavior rewards.
Feedback & Optimization – Use analytics and surveys to refine the approach continuously.
Reasoning:
Why is market research so important for social campaigns? Provide an example.

Answer:
Research uncovers real issues, preferences, and resistance points. It helps fine-tune messaging, channels, and timing.

Example:
The “Truth” anti-smoking campaign, based on insights that teens dislike manipulation, used rebellion-themed content instead of health warnings—making it far more relatable and effective in reducing youth smoking.

Scenario:
A mental health organization finds low participation in its counseling programs. How can its marketing process be improved?

Answer:

Identify Barriers – Address stigma, cost, or lack of awareness through surveys.
Normalize the Concept – Frame counseling as a tool for personal growth.
Use Digital Platforms – Share positive stories and mental health tips on social media.
Free Trials – Offer the first session for free or host open group events.
Partner with Influencers – Involve mental health advocates to boost credibility.
Make Access Easy – Simplify booking and offer multiple formats like text, call, or video sessions.
Reasoning:
Why is collecting feedback essential in social campaigns? Give an example.

Answer:
Feedback helps improve what doesn’t work and amplify what does. It ensures the campaign evolves with the audience.

Example:
The #LikeAGirl campaign by Always initially targeted young girls. Feedback showed older audiences also wanted to connect, so the campaign expanded its reach. This made it one of the most impactful gender equity campaigns globally.
